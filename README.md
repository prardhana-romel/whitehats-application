Name- Prardhana Romel

I wish to join WhiteHats to learn more about ethical hacking and cybersecurity and to meet like-minded people. I feel the club will help me grow not just in cybersecurity, but also in how I think, work with others, and gain hands-on experience through practical learning.

The latest cybersecurity incident I have read about is the 2024 Microsoft cloud logging incident, where Microsoft confirmed that a software bug caused the loss of over two weeks of critical security logs for several Microsoft security services.
